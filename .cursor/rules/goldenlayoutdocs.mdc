# Golden Layout Documentation Context Rule
#
# This file helps Cursor provide relevant documentation for Golden Layout.
#
# To make this effective:
# 1. Ensure you have added the Golden Layout documentation URL in
#    Cursor Settings -> Docs -> Add Docs URL (e.g., the official Golden Layout website).
# 2. When "Golden Layout" or similar terms are mentioned in your queries to Cursor,
#    this rule can help trigger the @Docs feature to provide relevant context.

# Example of how you might define a trigger and specify a doc source (syntax is hypothetical):
#
# WHEN query_contains("golden layout", "goldenlayout")
# USE_DOCS golden_layout_official_docs  // Assuming 'golden_layout_official_docs' is a name you gave in "Docs URL" settings.

# For actual syntax and advanced configurations, please refer to


# Cursor's official documentation on .mdc files and the @Docs feature.
